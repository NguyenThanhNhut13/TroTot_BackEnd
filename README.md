## üåê General Introduction

TroTot is a comprehensive microservices-based platform designed to connect landlords and tenants through an intelligent room rental system. The platform features AI-powered room recommendations, natural language search capabilities, and a robust user management system. Its goal is to connect tenants with landlords and automate many operations for optimal experience.

## üèõ Architecture

The platform follows a microservices architecture with the following components:

- **API Gateway**: Fronts all client requests and routes them to appropriate services
- **Service Discovery**: Dynamic registration and lookup of services using Eureka
- **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management
- **Message Broker**: Kafka for asynchronous communication
- **Dedicated Databases**: Isolated databases for each service for scalability
